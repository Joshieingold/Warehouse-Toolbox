To do:

Fixes:
 - App Crashes after Flexi-Import, likely due to not be able to establish a connection to the database.
 - App crashes when trying to load the database.
 - CTR update does not give time in between Ctr's to select the day.
 - Flexi-Import-Speed should be at a default of 700
 - WMS import needs to wait a second after it encounters an error and hold the next serial.
 - The print functions should get their data from the textbox not serial_lst
 - The default path to barcode should be C:\\BTAutomation\\barcodes.txt
 - Settings should apply right after save.
New:
 - Make option to import the CTR data at the speed you would like.
 - Update Icons
 - Importing needs a hault condition
 - Needs to display time elapsed 
 - Add ICO image 
 - Make the Textbar update saying which serial is being processed for the imports.
- Make outside label generator window.
- Make it so software isnt always locked to upload computer
- Make Auto Updater
- Make label after import say the elapsed time for the import.
